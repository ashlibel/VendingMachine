# VendingMachine
Practicing using an if statement to make a decision and writing code to act on that decision
determines the change to be dispensed from a vending machine.  An item in the machine can cost between 25 cents and 95 cents, in 5-cent increments (25, 30, 35, â€¦, 90, 95) and the machine only accepts a single dollar bill to pay for the item.  For example, a possible dialogue with the user might be

Enter price of item (from 25 cents to a dollar, in 5-cent increments):  45
You bought an item for 45 cents and gave me a dollar,
so your change is
2 quarters,
0 dimes, and
1 nickel.
